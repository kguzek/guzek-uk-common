# Guzek UK Common

A repository of common modules and utilities for the Guzek UK Website, used on the various deployed servers.

## Modules

Below is a list of all modules available in this library.

### logger

Used for obtaining a logger instance. Usage:

```ts
import { getLogger } from "guzek-uk-commons/logger";
const logger = getLogger(__filename);

logger.info("Hello, world!");
```

## maths

Used for Tu LaÅ‚em geographic calculations.

## models

Generic server-wide type definitions.

## sequelize

Model definitions for the database ORM.

## util

CRUD functions and general server-related functions.

## middleware

Exports an array factory containing middlewares which should be used on all servers. Usage:

```ts
import express from "express";
import { getMiddleware } from "guzek-uk-commons/middleware";

const app = express();
app.use(getMiddleware());
```

`useMiddleware()` produces an array of the following middlewares, which shouldn't be accessed directly:

### middleware/auth

Automatic request authentication and authorisation. If the request passes, this middleware adds the `user` object to the request object, to be used in later request handlers. Example:

```ts
import { UserObj } from "guzek-uk-common/models";

app.get("/my-uuid", (req, res) => {
  const user: UserObj | undefined = req.user;
  // If the authentication middleware was set to only allow logged in users to access this endpoint, `user` will definitely be of type `UserObj`.
  res.status(200).send(`Your UUID is ${user?.uuid}!`);
});
```

### middleware/headers

Adds `pragma` headers to all responses for proper caching.

### middleware/logging

Logs all requests made to the server, along with IP and request body.
